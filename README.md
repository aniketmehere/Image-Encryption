# üîê Image Encryption System in Python

This project encrypts and decrypts images securely using AES cryptography and image processing techniques. Developed as a beginner-level cybersecurity project.

## Features
- AES-128 CBC encryption
- Converts images to byte arrays for encryption
- Decrypts images back to original form
- Uses PyCryptodome, Pillow, and NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install pycryptodome pillow numpy

2. Put your image as `input_image.jpg` in the folder.

3. Run the program:
   python main.py

Encrypted image: `encrypted_image.bin`  
Decrypted image: `decrypted_image.jpg`
